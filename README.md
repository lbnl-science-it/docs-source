# How to set up a MkDocs site

We are building a new docs site for LBNL Science IT. At the pilot phase, the site is temporarily hosted on GitHub Page at  [https://lbnl-science-it.github.io/docs/](https://lbnl-science-it.github.io/docs/). For production, we may host the site on an LBNL server.

We use the static site generator [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) along with the theme [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) to build the docs site. Here are some concise instructions on how to maintain and update the site.
