# Cloud Resources

LBNL has a master payer program for cloud services on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).  This program provides the following benefits:

* No charge to have an account in the program
* Charges only for actual usage of cloud services like storage or compute
* Monthly billing for cloud usage are direct to your PID via recharge mechanism
* Simple enrollment process.  
* De-enrollment only changes the billing setup in your account, and your account will continue to be active.
* You maintain complete control of your own AWS or GCP dashboard, and your data, tools, and services in your account are only accessible by you.

Both AWS and GCP make discounts available to LBNL users for using their services.  Generally speaking, costs for using GCP will be lower than AWS due to lower pricing and additional discounts.  The discounts are:

| Type | AWS | GCP |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Overall | 7% | 13% | |
| Data Egress | 15% | 25% | For AWS, [restrictions apply](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/aws-offers-data-egress-discount-to-researchers/) |

Currently there are over 125 people at LBNL with cloud accounts on AWS and GCP.  Most commonly people use virtual machines and storage, however there are many advanced users using containerization, machine learning, AI, and data visualization services on both platforms.
