# Consulting & Training

Science IT provides on-demand and long-term "embedded" research consulting support, depending on your needs. We also support hiring of interns for science programs through the Science IT Intern program, as well as collaborative evaluation & support for hiring of staff to meet science project IT needs.  One email to scienceit@lbl.gov is all you need to do to get the help you want.

We provide a wide range of training opportunities -- all at no cost to science users. Via our partnerships with UCB's D-Lab, NSF's XSEDE, and AWS/GCP training programs we offer brown-bags, technical sessions, and custom opportunities to grow your IT skills.  For more information, and to register for upcoming events, please see ittraining.lbl.gov.
