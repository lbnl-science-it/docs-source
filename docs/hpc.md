# High-Performance Computing

Science IT supports and operates LBL's institutional high performance compute resource called Lawrencium. Lawrencium is a 55,000 core cluster which consist of shared nodes and PI-contributed condo nodes currently supporting compute needs across virtually every scientific discipline studied at LBL. For account information (including access to our PI Grant program) please see scs.lbl.gov.

* Support for both shared and private compute node hosting
* GPU nodes available now (Dual V100 with NVLink or Quad GTX1080Ti nodes) supporting machine learning and other needs
* High Speed Network connections between nodes - FDR & EDR Infiniband interconnect
* Users may also directly purchase service units ($0.01)  on-demand
